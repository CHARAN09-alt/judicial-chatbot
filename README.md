# JUDICIAL CHATBOT
<b>Background</b>: The Department of Justice (DoJ) under the Ministry of Law &
<br>
Justice, Government of India, manages judiciary operations. These include
<br>
building court infrastructure, fast-track courts for sensitive cases, the eCourts
<br>

The chatbot should assist users by answering questions such as:
<br>
a. Information on DoJ divisions.
<br>
b. Number of judges and court vacancies.
<br>
c. Case pendency via the National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG).
<br>
d. Steps for paying traffic fines, e-filing, and court case streaming.
